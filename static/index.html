        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through deep learning (DL) and large language
            models (LLMs), has marked a significant milestone in technological advancement, attributing to its
            unparalleled accuracy and generalization abilities. The rapid evolution of AI model structures to achieve
            superior performance underscores the dynamic progression and potential of AI technologies. However, the
            cornerstone of any AI's success lies not just in its algorithmic prowess but in the quality of data it is
            trained on. High-quality, accurate, consistent, and representative data sets are imperative for enhancing AI
            models' learning efficacy, thereby optimizing their generalization capabilities and reducing computational
            demands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond just leveraging quality data, AI technology itself plays a pivotal role in enhancing data quality
            through its powerful tools for data management. From cleaning, labeling, and validation to sophisticated
            feature engineering, AI ensures data accuracy, integrity, consistency, and reliability. This creates a
            symbiotic relationship between AI technology and high-quality data, highlighting their mutual dependence and
            the complementary nature of their interaction. It is this synergy that the 1st International Workshop on
            Data-driven AI (DATAI) aims to explore, delving into the latest research breakthroughs and presenting
            innovative techniques and methodologies at the forefront of data-driven AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            This workshop is dedicated to fostering a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between
            AI technologies and the data they depend on, focusing on the development of high-quality data specifically
            tailored for AI technologies, with a particular emphasis on large-scale models. Through engaging
            researchers, developers, and practitioners in rigorous discussions, the workshop seeks to explore sustained
            advancements, design innovations, and practical applications of data construction techniques that propel the
            progress of AI technologies forward.
        </p>

        <h2>Publication</h2>
        <p>All accepted papers are required to strictly follow the formatting guidelines as per the Camera Ready
            instructions outlined by VLDB. These guidelines are crucial for maintaining the integrity and uniformity of
            the workshop proceedings. Authors must ensure their submissions are prepared according to the instructions
            available at <a href="https://vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/17/formatting" target="_blank">VLDB Volume 17
                Formatting Guidelines</a>. Compliance with these formatting requirements is essential, as the template
            cannot enforce them. The final papers will be rigorously reviewed by the workshop PC members to ensure
            adherence to these standards before forwarding them to the VLDB workshop proceedings chairs for publication.
